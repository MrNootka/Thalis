body: 'Building an autonomous agent with Python involves several key steps. First,
  you need to define the goals and objectives of your agent. This will help you determine
  the tasks it needs to perform and the decisions it needs to make.


  Next, you will need to design the architecture of your agent. This includes deciding
  on the type of agent (e.g., reactive, deliberative, or hybrid) and the algorithms
  and techniques it will use.


  Once you have defined the goals and architecture, you can start implementing your
  agent in Python. You will need to write code that allows your agent to perceive
  its environment, reason about its current state, and take actions based on its goals
  and the information it has gathered.


  Python provides a wide range of libraries and frameworks that can be used to build
  autonomous agents. Some popular options include TensorFlow, PyTorch, and OpenAI
  Gym. These libraries provide tools for machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement
  learning, which are essential for building intelligent agents.


  During the implementation process, it is important to test and evaluate your agent''s
  performance. This can be done by running simulations or real-world experiments to
  assess how well your agent is able to achieve its goals.


  Finally, once your agent is built and tested, you can deploy it in the desired environment.
  This may involve integrating it with other systems or platforms, such as robotics
  or IoT devices.


  Building an autonomous agent with Python requires a solid understanding of programming
  concepts, as well as knowledge in areas such as artificial intelligence and machine
  learning. It is an exciting and challenging task that can lead to the development
  of intelligent systems capable of making autonomous decisions and performing complex
  tasks.'
