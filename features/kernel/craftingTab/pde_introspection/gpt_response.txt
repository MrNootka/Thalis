Here's a Python function that could be added to the system for the purpose of self-improvement. This function utilizes machine learning to learn from user interactions and past actions to improve its performance over time. The model is retrained periodically to incorporate recent data and feedback from users:

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

class SelfImprovement:

    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.model = RandomForestRegressor()

    def preprocess_data(self):
        self.data['input_length'] = self.data['input'].apply(len)
        self.data['output_length'] = self.data['output'].apply(len)
        
        X = self.data[['input_length', 'output_length']]
        y = self.data['rating']
        
        return X, y

    def train(self, X, y):
        X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
        self.model.fit(X_train, y_train)
        
        print('Model trained with score: ', self.model.score(X_test, y_test))

    def predict(self, input_length, output_length):
        predicted_rating = self.model.predict(np.array([input_length, output_length]).reshape(1,-1))
        return predicted_rating

    def improve(self):
        X, y = self.preprocess_data()
        self.train(X, y)
```

The `SelfImprovement` class accepts a DataFrame `data` containing past user interaction data with three columns: 'input', 'output', 'rating'. It is assumed that the 'input' is text entered by the user, the 'output' is the system response, and 'rating' is a performance measure given by the user.

The system attempts to predict the 'rating' based on the lengths of 'input' and 'output'. It trains a `RandomForestRegressor` model to learn a relationship between these lengths and the 'rating'.

The function can be further enhanced to include more features and a more suitable model can be chosen based on the context and availability of data.

Please note that actual function implementation would be sensitive to what actual context and data sources are available. Also, due care should be taken on the privacy and security aspects of user data.
